Fontastic - Font Showcasing for Pebble
======================================

This font preview app is based off the [app_font_browser] sample app and has been expanded to include many custom fonts and different text messages in each font.

It's published in the Pebble Appstore.  You do not need to compile the sample application yourself nor add additional fonts to preview.  This also shows off the necessary lines of code to load up your own custom fonts.

Usage
-----

Initially you are presented with a menu of different font options.  The up and down buttons navigate the list.  Pressing back will exit the app and pressing the select button will show you a demo page.

On the demo page you can press select to cycle through the available text messages to see how they are presented in the font.  The up and down buttons switch to the previous and next fonts.  The back button returns you to the menu.

That's all there is to it.


How To Compile
--------------

Fire up [CloudPebble] and import this project from GitHub by clicking [ImportToCloudPebble].  Open the source file `fontastic.c` and then press the green button to compile and send this to your phone.  Make sure you have the developer channel enabled on your phone and ideally it will get sent to your pebble within moments.


About the Fonts
---------------

These fonts have been hand selected for a variety of purposes.  Some are good digital watch faces, others are great for larger text and still more are good for smaller text.  The entire font family is included in the repository even if not all fonts are featured.  Use this app to get a good feel for the available fonts and then carefully study the entire family to make sure you get the font you need.

More Fonts?
-----------

Do you have one that you would like to include?  Drop me a line by filing a [feature request](https://github.com/fidian/pebble-fontastic/issues) or post in the [forum discussion].  Please keep in mind that only so many custom fonts can be included in the application because there's a hard limit of 96k of resources allowed.
